I am a PhD student at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong (HKU). Currently, my research interests include **reconfigurable computing**, **hardware accelerator system** and **computer architecture**. I joined the Computer Architecture and System Research (CASR) in September 2021, supervised by [Hayden Kwok-Hay So](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~hso/).

Before joining HKU, I was with the School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), China, where I obtained my Bachelor's Degree. I was supervised by [Chao Wang](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/WangChao/zh_CN/index.htm) in HUST. During undergraduate, I focused on energy-efficient neuromorphic computing and AI accelerators design.

In my leisure time, I like reading some suspense novels. Keigo Higashino is my favourite novelist. Besides, I spend my free time going swimming or hiking. Playing PC games is also one of my hobbies. I love many interesting games such as Dota2, City Skylines, Civilization series etc.
